        <li>
          we can implement the design of this page like something similar to cilium docs and
          elaborate about security
        </li>
        <li> then as mentioned we will then add relevent links to blogs and other stuff </li>
        <li>
          As due to unavailabilty of design guidelines plus the application time was limited, i was
          unable to implement the full structure of this page and thus just created this dummy
          route, but surely it will be done 100% in the mentorship period ðŸ˜Š
        </li>
